        I thought this project was very cool. At first I was very confused about the order in which to do the functions
        as I realized that some functions involve calling other functions. Once I was able to figure it out, finishing
        the main functions wasn't too much of an issue for me. Although I wasn't able to finish the application in time,
        I really enjoyed the project. I found the grow function to be the most difficult in my opinion. It did not
        include a test case, so when my insert function wasn't working, I kept thinking it was something wrong with my
        insert function itself and not the grow function being called. Maybe for the future add a grow test case so
        we can verify our work.
