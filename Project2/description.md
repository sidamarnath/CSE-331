<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/c3e7fecd-4807-44e5-bb0d-a41a9dfd2f0c/sorting_complexities.png" alt="sorting_complexities.png" /></p>
<p class="code-line">A&nbsp;<strong>sorting algorithm</strong>&nbsp;is an algorithm that puts elements in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">certain order</a>. Such algorithms are often used to organize an array or list in numerical or lexicographical order, however their use is not limited in scope to such simple orderings, or to such simple structures - a fact that will be demonstrated in this project.</p>
<p class="code-line">Throughout the 20th century, as the domain of problems to which computers were applied grew, so to did the size of data sets that required sorting. This resulted in the rapid development of sorting algorithms. Clearly&nbsp;<em>O(n<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;</em>algorithms, such an selection and bubble sort, were inferior to faster <em>O(nlog(n)) </em>algorithms, such as quick or merge sort, but by the 1970s even these weren't achieving speeds desired. This led to the development of ultra-optimized hybrid sorting algorithms, which tie together multiple sorting procedures recursively so as to apply the optimal sort to each chunk of data based on its size.</p>
<p class="code-line">This project focuses on the <em><strong>Insertion Sort</strong> </em>and the&nbsp;<strong><em>Merge Sort </em></strong>algorithms, and on a hybrid of the two. This hybridization is not merely a toy exercise - in fact, Python sorts its built in lists through a <a title="timsort" href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Objects/listsort.txt">hybrid of merge and insertion sort</a>.</p>
<h3 class="code-line">Insertion Sort</h3>
<p class="code-line"><img class="" alt="" /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/71bf53c7-b452-46c3-9d3b-84d2da030187/insertion_sort.png" alt="insertion_sort.png" /></p>
<p class="code-line">Insertion sort is an in place comparison based sorting algorithm. It builds a final sorted array by comparing one element at a time and inserting it into it's appropriate location.</p>
<p class="code-line">The worst case runtime is <em>O(n^2)</em>. The best case runtime is linear - in the case that the array is already sorted. The space complexity is O(1) for an in place implementation.</p>
<h3 class="code-line">Merge Sort</h3>
<p class="code-line"><img class="" alt="" /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/5aa69ad1-1cfd-4909-b14f-765027587102/merge_sort.png" alt="merge_sort.png" /></p>
<p class="code-line">Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">Divide and Conquer</a>. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merges those sublists in a manner that results in a sorted list.</p>
<p class="code-line">The runtime is <em>O(nlog(n)) and</em>&nbsp;<em>Theta(nlog(n))</em>. The space complexity is <em>O(n)</em> - new arrays are created everytime you divide. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28641693">Why isn't the space <em>O(nlogn)</em>?</a>)</p>
<h3 class="code-line">Hybrid Sort</h3>
<p class="code-line">While Merge Sort has a faster average runtime than Insertion Sort, there are instances that an Insertion Sort is more efficient. Due to the overhead of recursively splitting containers with a Merge Sort, Insertion Sort can have a faster performance with small sets of data. Thus, the two algorithms are often combined, with recursive calls to merge sort ceasing once the data is subdivided into small enough arrays.</p>
<h2 class="code-line">Project Details</h2>
<h3 class="code-line">Overview</h3>
<p class="code-line">You will be implementing the Insertion Sort Algorithm and the Merge Sort Algorithm. You will develop your Merge Sort such that it can be used as a Hybrid Sort when given a threshold value. The Hybrid Sort will rely on Merge Sort until the partitioned lists are less than or equal to a given threshold, at which point you will switch to Insertion Sort.</p>
<p class="code-line">These sorting algorithms will have an optional parameter that accepts a&nbsp;<em><strong>callable</strong> -</em> an object that can accept its own arguments and can even return its own object.&nbsp;<em>Callable&nbsp;</em>is the alias used by python's typing module for a <strong><em>Function- </em>in Python, functions are objects, and may be passed as arguments to other functions<em>.</em></strong> For this project, you will be creating simple functions to pass in as callables, which should determine how your sorting algorithms will sort. The default callable argument to our functions is a lambda function that is intended to sort your objects in the usual increasing order. For the application problem, you may need to create more complex functions that cannot be written as a lambda.</p>
<p class="code-line"><img class="" alt="" /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/c9ed1cbd-5a82-4e58-add3-3102d4d4ffd6/Project2Lambdaimage.png" alt="Project2Lambdaimage.png" /></p>
<p class="code-line">You'll want to use the above example,&nbsp;<em>comparator</em> to compare each element in the list you are sorting . <em>comparator</em> will only return true if the first parameter passed in, x, is less than or equal to the second parameter passed in, y. To use the comparator shown in the image above in your code, you'd write</p>
<pre class="code-line">if comparator(x, y):&nbsp; &nbsp; # does the same thing as if x &lt;= y in this case</pre>
<p class="code-line">In addition to these sorting algorithms, you will be implementing an algorithm to determine the&nbsp;<em>inversion count</em> of a list of elements. This algorithm will be integrated into your merge_sort function. You will only calculate the inversion count when your function is not being used as a Hybrid Sort, that is, when the threshold is 0.</p>
<p class="code-line">The inversion count is how far away a list of elements is from being sorted. The inversion count of a sorted array is 0. You can think of the number of inversions as the number of pairs of elements that are out of order.</p>
<p class="code-line"><strong>Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] &gt; a[j] and i &lt; j</strong></p>
<h5 class="code-line">Examples:</h5>
<p class="code-line"><strong>data = [3,2,9,0]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="code-line">data has 4 inversions:
<ul>
<li class="code-line">(3, 2): 3 &gt; 2 but 3 comes before 2</li>
<li class="code-line">(3, 0): 3 &gt; 0 but 3 comes before 0</li>
<li class="code-line">(2, 0): 2 &gt; 0 but 2 comes before 0</li>
<li class="code-line">(9, 0): 9 &gt; 0 but 9 comes before 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="code-line"><strong>data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="code-line">data has 0 inversions</li>
</ul>
<p class="code-line">Note: Although you can swap the elements of the inversions to form a sorted array, the inversion count is not the same as the minimum number of swaps to sort the array.</p>
<p class="code-line">For instance, data = [10, 1, 2, 0].</p>
<p class="code-line">You could sort this in 1&nbsp;<em>swap</em>&nbsp;(10, 0), but there are 5&nbsp;<em>inversions</em>&nbsp;(10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0).</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've been hired by the United States Navy to diagnose some serious problems in their fleet's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar">sonar technology</a>! It turns out that the sonar employed by Navy ships is unable to accurately perceive distance and makes frequent mistakes; often it perceives an object to be further away than it truly is, or closer.</p>
<p>This causes a conundrum. The Navy cannot retire its entire fleet, or attempt to repair it all at once -- the resources to do so simply do not exist. Instead, your colleagues have devised a test to determine which ships are in most urgent need of repair and which can continue service in their current state.</p>
<p>The entire navy fleet has been assembled in an empty patch of the Pacific Ocean and arranged in a way such that each ship can be located via satellite and assigned exact coordinates relative to one another. Each ship sends out a sonar pulse, locating all the other navy ships. If this ship's sonar was functioning correctly, it would first perceive the ship closest to it, and then second closest, and so on. Instead, it perceives nearby ships in seemingly random order (regardless of their physical coordinates). If a further ship is perceived before a closer ship, it is considered a mistake. Your job is to rank ships based on which make the least mistakes.&nbsp;<strong>IF TWO SHIPS MAKE THE SAME NUMBER OF MISTAKES, SORT THOSE SHIPS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER BASED ON THEIR NAME.</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at an example...</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/8057bfa5-db20-456d-83b5-452dc20fe962/Figure_1.png" alt="Figure_1.png" /></p>
<p>Here we see four ships plotted, the&nbsp;<em>USS Ian Barber,&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;<em>USS Andrew,&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;<em>USS Bank</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>UHH H</em>. These are coordinates <em>(-1,3), (-2,0), (0,6), </em>and <em>(-4,-4)</em><em>&nbsp;</em>respectively.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that while using its sonar, the&nbsp;<em>UHH H</em> perceives the other ships in this order:&nbsp;<em>USS Bank, USS Andrew,&nbsp;</em>and then the&nbsp;<em>USS Ian Barber</em>. Clearly, mistakes have been made.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the distances, as defined by the standard euclidean metric:</p>
<p><strong>D(H, Andrew) = sqrt( (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 ) = sqrt( (-4 - -2)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(20) = 4.47...</strong></p>
<p><strong>D(H, Ian) = 7.62...</strong></p>
<p><strong>D(H, Bank) = 10.77...</strong></p>
<p>The correct order should have been the <em>USS Andrew, USS Ian Barber, </em>and then the <em>USS Bank.</em></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>USS Bank&nbsp;</em>was perceived before both the <em>USS </em><em>Andrew&nbsp;</em>and the <em>USS </em><em>Ian. </em>This constitutes two mistakes because we have to swap the <em>USS Bank </em>with the <em>USS Ian Barber </em>and then the <em>USS Bank </em>with the <em>USS Andrew</em> afterward to fix this.</p>
<p>The <em>USS </em><em>Andrew </em>and the <em>USS Ian </em>were perceived in correct order relative to one another (the <em>USS </em><em>Andrew </em>came before the <em>USS Ian </em>as it should have), so this doesn't contribute any other mistakes to the count.</p>
<p>Continue this process for each ship, determining the number of mistakes made. From this, you will sort ships by least to most mistakes made.</p>
<p>Suppose the&nbsp;<em>UHH H </em>and the&nbsp;<em>USS Ian&nbsp;</em>both had equally faulty sonar, and thus both made two mistakes. Now, suppose the&nbsp;<em>USS Andrew&nbsp;</em>made only one mistake, and the&nbsp;<em>USS Bank&nbsp;</em>made zero mistakes.</p>
<p>In this case, we would first order based on mistakes made, giving a result of:</p>
<p><strong>[Bank, Andrew, Ian, H]</strong></p>
<p>However, since alphabetically the&nbsp;<em>UHH H&nbsp;</em>comes before the&nbsp;<em>USS Ian</em>, our final list would be:</p>
<p><strong>[Bank, Andrew, H, Ian]</strong>.</p>

<li>The file&nbsp;<code>plot.py</code>&nbsp;has been provided for comparing your sorting function's runtime.
<ul>
<li class="code-line">Run this file to see a graphical representation of your functions' performances.</li>
<li class="code-line">You may need to install matplotlib and numpy.
<ul>
<li class="code-line">If you are not familiar with the terminal instructions are here:&nbsp;<a title="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html</a></li>
