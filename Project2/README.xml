    <feedback>
        I thought this project was easier than I thought. I struggled with getting merge sort initially because I tried
        to code it in one function as opposed to seperating it into two functions. Once I realized it would be easier
        to do it that way, it was fairly straight forward. Each of the functions really helped me with the final
        application question since they had already done the dirty work for me. I really enjoyed coding this project.
