    <feedback>
        I thought this CC was a lot of fun. I initially struggled with the logic of solving the problem. I struggled
        with finding a way to get the smaller product but at the same index as the tree, but was able to figure it
        out in the end. I thought initially traversing through the tree was quite easy to get a sorted list as well
        as an index list, but struggled with appending the values to the new array, before finally deciding to fill my
        output array with 0's, and replacing the 0's with the appropriate values at the appropriate index's. Overall
        I had a fun time coding this CC.
