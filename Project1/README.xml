        I thought this project was very difficult. I feel that using DLL's and manipulating with nodes are not my
        strong suit yet, so I think it took me a lot longer to get this project done. I thought the first few functions
        were fairly straight forward. I struggled with the concept of reversing the DLL but eventually was able to
        figure it out after some guidance from websites. Overall, a really fun, but painful project. I was unable to
        complete the flurricane comprehensive test case since I couldn't figure out an error, even after debugging,
        which made the project frustrating.
